  <h1>Hey Kristin</h1>
  <h2>I have words to say about you</h2>
  <p>When we first met freshman year. I was really shy when I saw you. I didn't know that later on in life that we would be more than just friends. We had so much fun during common hour especially the carnevial event where we box each other out. You and I were having so much fun. Then I asked you out on a date, and I'm happy that you said yes! We walked down the street together, go to parks and watch. We have a wonderful time together. I have more things to say about you</p>
  <p>3 Things I like about you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are beautiful</li>
    <li>You are energetic</li>
    <li>You are perfect</li>
  </ul>
